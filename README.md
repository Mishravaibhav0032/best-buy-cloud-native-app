# Best Buy Cloud-Native Application - Staff-Service Microservice

## üîç Application and Architecture Overview

The **Best Buy Cloud-Native App** is a microservices-based demo application designed for internal use and customer-facing operations. It enables order management, product listing, and AI-enhanced product presentation through services deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The staff-service microservice is responsible for managing employee information in the system.

> The architecture follows the principles of the Algonquin Pet Store (On Steroids) with a key modification:
> **RabbitMQ** has been replaced with **Azure Service Bus**, a managed queueing service.

## üè† Updated Application Architecture

### Components:
- **Store-Front**: Frontend app for customers - IP Address to visit that http://130.107.224.231/ 
- **Store-Admin**: Admin dashboard for internal staff - IP Address to visit that http://130.107.225.174/orders
- **Order-Service**: Sends orders to Azure Service Bus
- **Product-Service**: Handles product CRUD operations
- **Makeline-Service**: Listens to Service Bus for order processing
- **AI-Service**: Generates AI product descriptions/images

## üìÜ Deployment Instructions

1. Clone all repositories listed above.
2. Build Docker images locally or pull them from Docker Hub.
3. Apply Kubernetes YAML files using:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f Deployment-Files/
   ```
4. Ensure ConfigMaps, Secrets, and ServiceBus connection strings are correctly configured.
5. Expose services via LoadBalancer for external access.

> MongoDB uses StatefulSet; ensure persistent volumes are created.

## ‚ùå Issues or Limitations

- MongoDB pods may restart on insufficient resource limits and service bus taking time in showing spikes.
- Initial latency in generating AI images through DALL-E but the quota's limit reached the size.
- AKS external IP allocation can take a few minutes.
